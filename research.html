<h2>Trident Project</h2>
<div class="outer"><div><img width="450" height="300" src="assets/media/postersession.jpg" alt="Our Trident poster session."></div></div>
<p>In 2017, I received the <a href="https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/index.php">Trident Scholarship</a> from the Naval Academy. The Trident Scholarship allowed me to devote 24 credit-hours (total) towards research. My advisor, Prof Kostya Medynets, and I chose to look at mathematical swarm models. In particular, we were interested in the parabolic potential model, a model for swarms based on spring-like attraction. In a system of \(N\) agents, each of which has position vector \(r_i\), the parabolic potential model has the following equation of motion:\[\ddot{r}_i=(1-\lvert\dot{r}_i\rvert^2)\dot{r}_i-(r_i-R)\] where \(R\) is the center of mass of the system, given by\[R=\sum_{i=1}^Nr_i\] Expected limit behavior is pictured below:</p>

<p>Over the course of a year, we proved several new results about the stability of this system. We were fortunate to observe some behavior that has never been seen before.</p>

<p>Prof Medynets has his own website, <a href="https://sites.google.com/usna.edu/medynets/">which you can see here</a>.
<h2>Work at NRL</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2017, I worked at <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval Research Laboratory</a> in Washington, DC with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MG9YypEAAAAJ&hl=en">Ira Schwartz</a>. Primarily, I researched swarm collisions in systems subject to delay. We summarized our findings in a report, titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08817">The Dynamics of Interacting Swarms</a>". It is available on the ArXiv.</p>


<h2>Mathematica, ROS, and Gazebo Integration</h2>
<p>In the course of my work on swarming, I have looked at applications to UAVs. I spent some time getting differential equation models (simulated in <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Wolfram Mathematica</a>) to drive virtual drones (simulated in <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo</a>) using <a href= "http://www.ros.org/">ROS, the Robot Operating System</a> to interface between the two. A video of my work is available on Youtube:</p>

<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>In 2018, I received the <a href="https://www.usna.edu/MathDept/about/awards/index.php#panel5JulianClancyFrazierAwardforExcellenceinMathematics">Julian Clancy Frazier Award</a> for excellence in Mathematics.</p>
