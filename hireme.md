<div class="center-image"><h2>***<a href="/assets/media/resume.pdf">Read My Resume Here</a>***</h2></div>

I'm leaving the Navy in May, and looking for a new job.

## Why You Should Hire Me

- I have spent the last 5 years in nuclear engineering, doing a technically rigorous, challenging job.
- **I lead engineering teams**. The smallest was 9 people, the largest was 62.
- **I'm a top performer in my current job**. See below.
- **I have a detailed theoretical and technical background**. I was a [Trident Scholar](https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/index.php) at the Naval Academy, and did research in applied mathematics for years, which you can read about [here](/research.html).
- **I have research experience** with Python, ROS, C#, Mathematica, and Git. I have [personal/hobbyist experience](/blog.html) with a lot of other languages and tools.

## I'm a Top Performer

- On my submarine, I am the **number one** Junior Officer (out of 12).
- I was Submarine Squadron Eight's **[Junior Officer of the Year](https://twitter.com/USNavyCNO/status/1514746334250782720?s=20&t=u5yN-Qy6hvtkz1wcrMx8AQ)** (out of ~80) in 2022.
- I graduated **top of my class** from [PNEO](https://allhands.navy.mil/Stories/Display-Story/Article/1839925/call-me-a-nuclear-engineer/), a course which certifies Naval Nuclear Engineers.
- I've spent 3 months acting as the ship's **Engineer**. The Engineer is the third most senior officer aboard, usually with 6-12 years of experience. I was responsible for 62 people and over a billion dollars of equipment.

## What I Do Now

My job description is a little confusing, so here are some key aspects of my work:

- Overall, my job is to take technical projects and push them to completion.
- I have operational experience as a watch officer, leading an 8-person watchteam over 5 test programs. This includes executing once-in-a-lifetime hydrostatic tests, non-critical steaming, and initial criticality and certification of the ship's reactor.
- I have extensive training and experience in casualty response ([like this](https://youtu.be/ajK1QMP7ZyI)). I have responded to countless simulated emergencies, and around ten real ones.
- Besides certifying the ship for operation, I also help certify the crew. I have spent the last year managing the training and inspections necessary to prepare the ship for criticality.
- I also deal with the processes we use to build a nuclear-powered warship. A large portion of my job these days involves conversations with regulators and commercial entities to lay the groundwork for our next milestones.

## What I'm Looking For

- I want a job that will change the world.
- I want my work to be technical.
- I'd like to have the opportunity to manage a team.
