"What would make you stay in?"

We were asked this question over and over in April, 2022. I had just been selected as the Submarine Squadron Eight Junior Officer of the Year, and was in Washington, DC with a group of 9 other JOs from submarines across the US. Being selected as a JO of the Year puts you in around the top 1% of Submarine Officers, and confers a huge advantage over your peers, even 10 to 15 years down the line. Because of this, I figured that many of my cohort would choose to stay in the Navy, and the trip to DC was supposed to cement that. It included tours around the Pentagon, conversations with Admirals, and a few fancy events that I could attend with my wife, Jackie.

When I met the rest of the group, I was surprised that only two out of the ten of us were planning on signing Department Head contracts. The rest were presumably planning to leave the Navy, like I was. It's no secret that the Navy has a manning crisis, and in a way, I felt like an ambassador of the problem.

I thought about my future a lot on that trip. What would make me stay? I love my job in the Navy, and I'm good at it, so why was I so desperate to leave? When I was asked what would make me stay, I said that if I could know, for sure, where I would be for the next 7 years, I would sign a contract. Honestly, though, I still doubted if that would be enough.
