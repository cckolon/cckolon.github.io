I use Google Analytics right now, but I'm phasing it out in favor of my custom-made analytics system.

I respect your privacy and collect only limited technical and usage data to understand how you access the site.

## What I collect

- Anonymized IP addresses and technical details about your connection.
- Data about your platform, like whether you're on a computer or mobile device.
- Engagement data like scroll depth and time spent on page.

## What I do with it

- I use the data I collect to understand usage patterns and try to improve my content. My legal basis under the GDPR is legitimate interest, or Article 6(1)(f).
- I save the data in a secure Postgres instance inside a virtual private cloud (VPC).
- I aggregate it and view it using an open-source service that I host myself.

## What I don't do

- I don't use cookies.
- I don't try to track you across sessions or deanonymize your information.
- I don't store your full IP address. It's truncated to 24 bits (IPV4) or 48 bits (IPV6).
- I will never sell or share your data.

## Contacting me or opting out
- You can contact me at the email address on my homepage.
- If you want to disable collection of all information, you can block my analytics url, `cck.sh`. For example, on Chrome, you can follow [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network-request-blocking).
