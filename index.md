I'm a Software Engineer at [Vannevar Labs](https://www.vannevarlabs.com/). I live in San Francisco. For 5 years I was a Submarine Officer in the US Navy. Before that, I was a [Trident Scholar](https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/index.php) in Mathematics at the US Naval Academy. This is my personal website.

When I was in the Navy, I wished for these applications, so after I left I built them.

- [ewatchbill.com](https://ewatchbill.com/): a fair in-port schedule generator.
- [jfmm.net](https://jfmm.net): semantic search for the Navy's biggest, nastiest manual.
- [bearingsonly.net](https://bearingsonly.net): a realistic submarine combat game.

I like to write, especially about math, coding, and the outdoors. [Take a look at some of my articles here](/blog).

I did a lot of math work at the Naval Academy. [You can read about it here](/research). The main topic of my research is the stability of mathematical swarm models.
