I'm a Submarine Officer in the US Navy, currently working in Norfolk, Virginia. At the US Naval Academy, I was a [Trident Scholar](https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/index.php) in Math. This is my personal website. Obviously, nothing posted here represents the opinions of the Navy or DoD.

I've done a lot of math work at the Naval Academy. [You can read about it here](research.html). The main topic of my research is the stability of mathematical swarm models.
