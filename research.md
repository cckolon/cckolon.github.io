## Presentations

In 2018, I presented my work at the Trident Scholar Conference. You can watch my presentation below:

That year, I also presented at the [University of Maryland's Graduate Mathematics Seminar](https://www-math.umd.edu/gcal_rss.php?seminar_key=SDYN&year=2018&html#:~:text=Stability%20of%20Nonlinear%20Swarms%20on%20Flat%20and%20Curved%20Surfaces), and the Service Academy Student Mathematics Conference at the US Coast Guard Academy.

## Trident Scholarship

In 2017, I received the [Trident Scholarship](https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/index.php) from the Naval Academy. The Trident Scholarship allowed me to devote 24 credit-hours (total) towards research. My advisor, Prof Kostya Medynets, and I chose to look at mathematical swarm models. In particular, we were interested in the parabolic potential model, a model for swarms based on spring-like attraction. In a system of \\(N\\) agents, each of which has position vector \\(r_i\\), the parabolic potential model has the following equation of motion:

$$\ddot{r}_i=(1-\lvert\dot{r}_i\rvert^2)\dot{r}_i-(r_i-R)$$

where \\(R\\) is the center of mass of the system, given by

$$R=\sum_{i=1}^Nr_i$$

Expected limit behavior is pictured below:

Over the course of a year, we proved several new results about the stability of this system. We were fortunate to observe some behavior that has never been seen before.

## Internship at NRL

In summer 2017, I interned at the [Naval Research Laboratory](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/) in Washington, DC, advised by Dr. [Ira Schwartz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MG9YypEAAAAJ&hl=en). I researched swarm collisions in systems subject to delay. We summarized our findings in a report, titled [The Dynamics of Interacting Swarms](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/trecms/AD1049505), published by the Defense Technical Information Center.

## Mathematica, ROS, and Gazebo Integration

In the course of my work on swarming, I researched applications to unmanned systems. I spent some time getting differential equation models (simulated in [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica)) to drive virtual drones (simulated in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)) using [ROS, the Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/) to interface between the two. A video of my work is available on Youtube:

## Awards

In 2018, I received the [Julian Clancy Frazier Award](https://www.usna.edu/MathDept/about/awards/index.php#panel5JulianClancyFrazierAwardforExcellenceinMathematics) for excellence in Mathematics.
